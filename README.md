Add To Omnifocus Firefox Extension (Unofficial)
-----------------------------------------------

This extension provides you with a Add to Omnifocus button, to add the current page to Omnifocus.
I tried to make the behaviour compatible with the [Send to OmniFocus extension for Chrome by Leonid Shevtsov](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/send_to_omnifocus.crx).
